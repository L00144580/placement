There are two types of request made by a browser
1.http
2.https

https is a secure request and is http is not a secure request.
By using 'cURL'function to make request to web browser http &https.
First will Make a HTTP request to Google.
<?php
if (isset($_POST["submit"])) {
 $curl=curl_init();
curl_setopt($curl,CURLOPT_URL, 'http://www.google.com/');
curl_exec($curl);
}

?>


Second step will make a https request to Google which is secure
<?php
if (isset($_POST["submit"])) {
 $curl=curl_init();
curl_setopt($curl,CURLOPT_URL, 'https://www.google.com/');
curl_exec($curl);
}

?>
